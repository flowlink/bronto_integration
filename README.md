# Bronto Integration

This integration is designed to integrate Wombat with
[Bronto](http://bronto.com/) API.

This is a fully hosted and supported integration for use with the [Wombat](http://wombat.co)
product. With this integration you can perform the following functions:

* Add and update contact info in Bronto
* Persist orders and product info linked to contacts in Bronto
* Add and remove contacts to predefined lists in Bronto
* Send transactional emails based on custom events

[Wombat](http://wombat.co) allows you to connect to your own custom integrations.
Feel free to modify the source code and host your own version of the integration
or better yet, help to make the official integration better by submitting a pull request!
